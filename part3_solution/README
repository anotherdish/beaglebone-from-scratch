# INTERACTIVE EXERCISE

this part is just going to be for playing around with linker scripts, because as i am doing stuff i realized that i want more reps in there

OBJECTIVE:

using the following binaries: `arm-none-eabi-as`, `arm-none-eabi-ld`, and `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`, give me a linker script that will arrange the sections in `startup.s` in alphabetical order, and putting all of the sections in the output file's text section

the output should look like this

# SOluTION

1. run `arm-none-eabi-as -o startup.o startup.s` to assemble the startup file
   you can use `arm-none-eabi-ld --sections startup.o` to see/list the sections
2. `arm-none-eabi-ld -T solution.ld -o startup.elf startup.o` to link the object file into an elf file
3. use `arm-none-eabi-objdump -s -j .text startup.elf` to dump the contents of the `.text` section
