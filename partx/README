* BEAGLEBONE FROM SCRATCH

the purpose of this repo is to compile all of the stuff required to get a beaglebone black running (cross compiler, bootloader (uboot), and the kernel)

you then are going to shove this guy into a beaglebone black

NEXT

we are going to rip the stuff off of a beagleboneblack and emulate it in qemu system so we can pretend like we are trying to emulate the contents of a arbitrary iot device
